# Webots-Sumo-Integration
This repository contains a step-by-step guide and the necessary files for integrating Webots (a robot simulation software) with SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). The goal of this project is to set up a smooth interface between Webots and SUMO, allowing for coordinated traffic simulations, where SUMO acts as the traffic controller and Webots simulates the environment.

In this repository, you will find the steps to:

Convert an OpenStreetMap (OSM) file into a Webots world file.
Set up and configure SUMO to control the traffic in the Webots environment.
Here is a step-by-step guide to getting started with converting an OSM file to a Webots world file and integrating it with the SUMO traffic simulation.
